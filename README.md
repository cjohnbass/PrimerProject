#Log
I started with writing out cgi script in python. Then I wrote some html that gets info (image from instagram) from another server. The HTML is also embeded with a hyperlink that redirects you to "nba.com". Next I added CSS style sheet to the webpage. I finished with the query page by copying and pasting the HTML source of "lakers.com" to query.html.
